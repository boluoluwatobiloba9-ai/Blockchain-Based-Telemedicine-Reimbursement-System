# 🩺 Blockchain-Based Telemedicine Reimbursement System

Welcome to a revolutionary telemedicine reimbursement system built on the Stacks blockchain! This project automates payments to healthcare providers in low-income regions, ensuring timely and transparent reimbursements based on verified telemedicine service delivery.

## ✨ Features

- 🩺 **Service Registration**: Providers register telemedicine sessions with patient details and service hashes.
- 💸 **Automated Payments**: Smart contracts trigger payments from funders to providers upon service verification.
- 🔍 **Transparency**: Immutable records of services and payments on the blockchain.
- ✅ **Verification**: Patients and funders can verify service delivery.
- 🚫 **Fraud Prevention**: Prevents duplicate claims and unauthorized payments.
- 📊 **Fund Management**: Tracks available funds and disbursements for transparency.
- 👥 **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for providers, patients, and funders.
- 🌍 **Low-Income Focus**: Streamlined process to ensure affordability and accessibility.

## 🛠 How It Works

### For Healthcare Providers
1. Register a telemedicine session by submitting a unique service hash, patient ID, and session details.
2. The session is recorded on the blockchain via the `service-registry` contract.
3. Upon patient confirmation, the `payment-processor` contract automatically disburses funds from the fund pool to the provider.

### For Patients
1. Verify the completion of a telemedicine session using the `service-verifier` contract.
2. Confirm service delivery to trigger payment to the provider.

### For Funders (e.g., NGOs, Governments)
1. Deposit funds into the `fund-manager` contract to create a reimbursement pool.
2. Monitor disbursements and verify service claims via the `audit-log` contract.

### For Auditors
1. Use the `audit-log` contract to review all transactions and service records.
2. Ensure compliance and transparency in fund allocation.
